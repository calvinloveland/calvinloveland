## Programming with AI

- I treat AI as a pair-programmer for exploration, scaffolding, and rapid iteration.
- I keep humans in control of architecture, tradeoffs, and final quality decisions.
- I prefer small reviewable diffs, tests-first for fixes, and clear constraints for better AI output.
- I use AI to automate repetitive work so I can spend more time on design and reliability.
